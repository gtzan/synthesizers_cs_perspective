# Assignment 2 

DSP AND MIDI 
------------------

In this assignment we will explore some fundamental DSP concepts 
to better understand the concepts we covered in class. In addition, 
we will look into the MIDI communication protocol and file format for 
controlling synthesizers and storing performance information. 

Similarly to the first assignment I will use the term familiar programming 
language to refer to the ones that you probably have encountered during your 
studies: Python, C, C++, Java, and Javascript. As you probably can guess I will use the
term unfamiliar programming language to refer to any other programming
language such as: Haskell, OCaml, Prolog, Rust, Go, Julia, Ruby, C#, F#
R, etc.


1. (Basic)

Connect directly using MIDI two hardware devices without going through a computer (sometimes 
this is termed a DAWLESS setup). Write a short text description of which devices you connected 
and what issues you had to figure out. You will need to read a bit about MIDI input, output, and cables. 
A classic example could be connecting a MIDI keyboard and generating sound in a different keyboard or rack-mount synthesizer but it does not have to be a keyboard or synthesizers as long as it is clear you have 
two devices communicating with each other. 

2. (Basic) 

Show using a figure and math that multiplying the complex number $(2+1j)$ with $j$
