# Assignment 2 

DSP AND MIDI 
------------------

In this assignment we will explore some fundamental DSP concepts 
to better understand the concepts we covered in class. In addition, 
we will look into the MIDI communication protocol and file format for 
controlling synthesizers and storing performance information. 

Similarly to the first assignment I will use the term familiar programming 
language to refer to the ones that you probably have encountered during your 
studies: Python, C, C++, Java, and Javascript. As you probably can guess I will use the
term unfamiliar programming language to refer to any other programming
language such as: Haskell, OCaml, Prolog, Rust, Go, Julia, Ruby, C#, F#
R, etc. I will use the term computer music textual languages to refer to languages 
that have extensive support and primitives for sound and music manipulation such as 
Chuck, Supercollider, Csound, Nyquist, and Faust and visual programming languages 
for languages such as PureData and Max/MSP. 

Unless explicitly stated you can use any programming languages for implementing 
the questions. If you need access to devices ask me via email or through Discord for 
access to ECS602. 


1. (Basic) **MIDI to MIDI communication** 

Connect directly using MIDI two hardware devices without going through a computer (sometimes 
this is termed a DAWLESS setup). Write a short text description of which devices you connected 
and what issues you had to figure out. You will need to read a bit about MIDI input, output, and cables. 
A classic example could be connecting a MIDI keyboard and generating sound in a different keyboard or rack-mount synthesizer but it does not have to be a keyboard or synthesizers as long as it is clear you have 
two devices communicating with each other. 

2. (Basic) **COMPLEX NUMBER MULTIPLICATION** 

Show using a figure, programming, and math what is the result multiplying the complex number $(2+j)$ with $j$. For programming, represent the complex number as an array, list, or tuple and directly implement the complex number multiplication in terms of real and imaginary parts without using any built-in libraries or types for complex numbers. 

3. (Basic) **MIDI to COMPUTER** 

Connect a hardware MIDI device to your laptop or desktop. Write code that prints out MIDI messages whenever they are received. Some devices can connect directly through USB, there are cheap USB to MIDI converters or you can go through an audio interface that has MIDI functionality. Similarly to question 1, just document your experience, what challenges you encountered, and what you learned. 


4. (Basic) **Amplitude Estimation in Mixtures** Create one second of audio by summing the following sinusoidal frequencies ($100Hz, 200Hz, 300Hz$) all with the same phase, and three random amplitudes between $0.0$ and $1.0$. Listen to the generated sound and create 4 plots one for each individual sinusoid and one for the resulting mixed sound. Each plot should correspond to the time duration of one period of the lowest sinusoid ($100Hz$). Show how you can estimate these three random amplitudes by taking the dot product of the mixture with basis sinusoids of amplitude 1 for the three frequencies ($100Hz, 200Hz, 300Hz$). 


5. (Expected) **Amplitude and Phase Estimation in Mixture** This is an extension of question 4. Extend your code from question 4 so that the three sinusoidal components have random phases in addition to random amplitudes. Listen to the generated sound and create 4 plots one for each individual sinusoid and one for the resulting mixed sound. Each plot should correspond to the time duration of one period of the lowest sinusoid ($100Hz$). Show how the amplitudes and phases can be estimated for this sound in two ways: a) by brute force checking even possible phase value and selecting that one that results in the highest dot product with a basis sinusoid of the appropriate frequency b) by taking the dot product of the mixture with a sine component and a cosine component. 

6. (Expected) **MIDI Arpeggiator**

Write a MIDI arepggiator. First you will need to have code for writing MIDI messages and a device for playing sound. For this question you can use software synthesizers or other software for the sound generation pehraps you simple synth from the previous assignment i.e you don't need a hardware MIDI device. The input to the arpeggiator will be a set of MIDI note numbers, a tempo, and a mode (up, down, up/down, random) and the output will be repeating patterns of MIDI note messages that when played by a software synthesizer correspond to the arpeggiated notes. 

7. (Expected) Write code to generate a simple note of an arbitrary frequency - the note should have a simple ADSR envelope and not be a simple sine wave. Using this code play "scales" i.e all the notes going up and down for different equal temperament tuning systems. Generate scales for the following 3-equal temperament, 4-equal temperament, 5-equal temperament, ..., 12-equal temperament. Use 110Hz as your first note and in addition to the scale going up and down play a fixed drone throughout at 110Hz using a continuous version of the same "instrument" i.e it has only an attack and sustain but no release until the full scale is played. Briefly comment on what you hear for the different systems. 

8. (Expected) Write code that takes as input a time in minutes and seconds and converts that to two complex numbers corresponding to the positions of the minute hand and second hand on a clock. What complex number do we need to multiply a particular second hand position to move by one second (clockwise)? What complex number of we need to multiply to move by one second (counter-clockwise). Show your answer by creating a corresponding plot. 

You only need to implement 2 advanced questions.
