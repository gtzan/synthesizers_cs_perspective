## Course Overview 

This course will exlore synthesizers from a computer science perspective. Synthesizers are devices that produce sounds electronically and allow the user to modify, interact, and shape the generated sounds. The main focus 
of the course will be on software implementation rather than hardware, music creation, and sound design although we will touch on these topics peripherally. More specifically, we look at software emulations of existing synthesizers, 
creating novel software synthesizers, and explore how they can be integrated to environments of music creation and digital audio workstation software. In the process, we will learn about digital signal processing, synthesis algorithms, human-computer interaction,
machine learning, and audio programming. This is a course that will require significant amounts of programming as well as understanding and modifying existing code. The students will learn the material through the completion of several individual assignments 
and group projects. Experience with music notation and/or music technology is not required but will be very helpful to have.
