# Assignment 3 

Modal synthesis, filters, spectral analysis and FM synthesis 
------------------------------------------------------------

In this assignment we will explore some fundamental DSP concepts 
to better understand the concepts we covered in class. In addition, 
we will look into the MIDI communication protocol and file format for 
controlling synthesizers and storing performance information. 

Similarly to the first assignment I will use the term familiar programming 
language to refer to the ones that you probably have encountered during your 
studies: Python, C, C++, Java, and Javascript. As you probably can guess I will use the
term unfamiliar programming language to refer to any other programming
language such as: Haskell, OCaml, Prolog, Rust, Go, Julia, Ruby, C#, F#
R, etc. I will use the term computer music textual languages to refer to languages 
that have extensive support and primitives for sound and music manipulation such as 
Chuck, Supercollider, Csound, Nyquist, and Faust and visual programming languages 
for languages such as PureData and Max/MSP. 

Unless explicitly stated you can use any programming languages for implementing 
the questions. Using a computer music language moves the degree of difficulty down and using an unfamiliar programming language moves it up. For example if you implement question 6 in Max/MSP or Chuck it counts as basic rather than expected. If you implement question 6 in an unfamiliar programming languages it can count as advanced. In general, I am flexible so if you want to adjust things just let me know. Also if you 
think of a question of comparable difficulty that you would like do again let me know and most likely 
it should be ok.
