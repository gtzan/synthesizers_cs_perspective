# Project Ideas (Please check regularly) 

This page is going to be evolving over the course of the term with more details as the projects get more fleshed out. Similarly to the assignments, the projects 
are labeled by their degree of difficulty (basic, expected, advanced). The total points for all project activity is 50. Membership in project is going to be fluid 
so for example you might decide to participate in multiple projects at different levels of engagement or focus on a single one on your own. 10 of the 50 
points are reserved for advanced projects, 20 of the 50 points have to be advanced or expected, and the remaining 20 can be advanced, expected, or basic. 
That way if you feel that particular level of difficulty is too easy, you can work on a higher level of difficulty.
