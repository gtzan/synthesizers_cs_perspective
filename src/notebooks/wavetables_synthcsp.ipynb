    "As memory costs when down in the 1980s, it became possible to store samples of musical sounds rather than generating them with analog circuitry. In order to save memory it is common to store just one loop instance of the periodic part of the sound and repeat it during playback as needed. The array storing the samples is called the **wavetable**. The attack portion can also be stored as an array digital samples. The resulting synthesizers are called samplers and were able to immitate acoustical musical instruments sounds much more accurately than analog synthesizers. "

    "\n",
    "1. The sawtooth signals that correspond to the phase increments are sometimes called phasors. One can support polyphony using the same wavetable by using multiple phasors to generate different frequencies. One can think of the wavetable as a a circular array of values sometimes called a ring buffer that is being read at different sampling rates using interpolation. It is also possible to have multiple wavetables for supporting polyphony. The multiple phasors approach supports polyphony of the same underlying waveform but having multiple wavetables supports polyphony with potentially different oscillators (multi-timbrality) \n",
    "\n",
    "2. To provide more flexibility the wavetable oscillator(s) can take as argument time-varying envelopes for amplitude, frequency, and phase. For example one could add Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release envelopes for the amplitude. This generalizes oscillators to the concept of unit-generators that are fundamental building blocks in most computer music languages and programming environments and enables various types of interesting modulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. In languages that support object-oriented programming one can write the oscillators as objects and keep their state (for example phase-increment) as part of the object. This also allows the creation of more complex architectures like patches of unit generators. \n",
