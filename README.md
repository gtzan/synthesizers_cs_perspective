# Synthesizers: a computer science perspective 
## George Tzanetakis

A repository containing information and resources used in the teaching of the course **Synthesizers: a computer science perspective**. This course is developed by George Tzanetakis and was first taught in January 2023 as 4th year computer science and graduate topics course. Synthesizers are musical instruments that generate sound using electrical signals. They generate sound waveform using a variety of synthesis methods and modify the resulting waveforms using various types of audio effects. The various sound generating and transforming modules are connected in various topologies and controlled using a variety of hardware controls such as sliders and rotary knobs and typically a keyboard for playing notes similar in layout to piano and organ keyboards. The course explores synthesizers using a computer science pespective focus on software implementation. 

This is not a course about hardware design, or about how to write music using synthesizers, or about how to design sounds although these topics will be touched upon. It is more a course exploring how one can better understand how synthesizers work by implementing various synthesis methods and audio effects and looking at existing software frameworks and implementations. A pluralistic approach will be followed in which the same concepts will be implemented in a variety of programming languages and software frameworks. We will be focusing on the digital synthesizers of the 1980s as they are simpler to understand and implement but will also discuss both earlier approaches as well as more modern devices and concepts. 

The course is structured in learning modules covering different concepts related to synthesizers. Each module contains the following components: 
  1. Signal processing description 
  2. Software implementations
  3. Historical Dive 
  4. Software Anatomy 
  5. Music/Videos
